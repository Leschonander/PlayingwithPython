### VenmoBot

While it is known that Venmo transactions are public,
they are much more public then you might exepect.
[Here](https://venmo.com/api/v5/public?limit=100) is a link to their **public** api that shows the last 100 public transactions that appeared on Venmo.

This is a rather nasty privacy issue.

This tweet bot tweets out information about the transactions, in a attempt to spread awerness and make sure people make their transactions private so the general public doesn't have to see their semi-illegal late night Venmo requests. 

Keys not included, get your own Twitter developer keys...

Made opensource to spread awareness about this issue.
