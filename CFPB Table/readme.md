Simple little project based off of the week 4 project of Stanford's Computational Journalism class taught in their graduate school.

Neat fact about Pandas, it can programmatically generator HTML tables with the following command:
```python
df.to_html
```
Useful tool when displaying data...

Link below to part of the table as an example.
