I had a look at the accidental drugs deaths in [Connecticut](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015/resource/6b4b5112-4ab7-4b47-bcad-c9003dad0cf3) and visualized some of the data points. Its not a good picture.

Notes: 

* `URL_FOR` works for other links as well, not in the files because of size but was able to load a oversized Geojson file to look at all the deaths in the data set along with being able to click on the points with more information.
* Leaflet.js works well with Flask actually.
* We need to stop the new drug crisis, seriously the numbers are bad.
